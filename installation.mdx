# Instatrace Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Instatrace application. We will cover the installation, configuration, and usage of Instatrace.

## Installation

To install Instatrace, follow these steps:

1. Download the Instatrace agent from the official website.
2. Install the agent on your servers by following the provided instructions.

## Configuration

After installing the Instatrace agent, you will need to configure your application to send trace data and metrics to Instatrace. Here's an example of how to configure Instatrace using a React component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Instatrace from 'instatrace';

const InstatraceConfig = () => {
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState('');

  const handleApiKeyChange = (event) => {
    setApiKey(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    Instatrace.configure({ apiKey });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="apiKey">API Key:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="apiKey"
        value={apiKey}
        onChange={handleApiKeyChange}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InstatraceConfig;
```
